For the past 6 months I have been enrolled in the NYU Tandon Bridge Online in Computer Science.
Now that the program has wrapped up and grades have been released I want to share my thoughts
on the experience.

#### What is NYU Tandon Bridge Online?

This is an online only program offered by NYU Tandon for students who want a Masters degree
in Computer Science or related field, but have an undergrad degree in another field. The price
is very reasonable at around $3000, and if you pass the course with a B+ or higher NYU will
admit you straight into the Masters program.

For [full disclosure](https://www.credential.net/7602sf1x)
I received an A in this course but chose not to pursue the Masters at this time.
